# Linear Regression
## Comparsion Regression methods
### OLS (Ordinary Least sqaure)
- Works best for small dataset.
- Time taken to find slope will be high for large dataset.
### Gradient Descent
- Depends on learning rate. (choose carefully)
- Batch computes on entire dataset. (stable but slow for big data)
### Improved Gradient Descent
- **Have to understand the code then fill this part**
- feature scaling.
### Ridge Regression
- Handling outliers efficiently.
